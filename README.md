## Features

#### Animated tile and backgound while swiping. Add padding to tile. Swipe to trigger action.

The package is fork of [Dismissible](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Dismissible-class.html). Without any vertical, up and down swipe.

### Problems with dismissible

1. Dismissible doesn't allow animated rounded corner and elevation similar to google Gmail, Telegram, Messages (these are android apps) if you swipe you will notice. Here is the result with Dismissible.

2. Dismissible can't make rounded Card there is always some UI issue. Here is the result with Dismissible.

3. It's not possible to animated the background while swiping.

4. Swipe to trigger action function. Similar to telegram or instagram DM message reply.

## How to use?

#### Installation

Add `swipeable_tile` to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies then run `flutter pub get`

```yaml
dependencies:
  swipeable_tile:
```

#### Import

Add this line to import the package.

```dart
import 'package:swipeable_tile/swipeable_tile.dart';
```

### Do and don't

- Don't call `setState()` from `backgroundBuilder`.
- Set the `Scaffold`'s (or whatever background widget you are using) `backgroundColor` and `SwipeableTile` or `SwipeableTile.swipeToTrigger`'s `color` same.

### There are four named constructors:

1. `SwipeableTile` When the tile is swiped there will be an elevation (remove elevation by setting `isElevated` to `false`) and rounded corner to the tile (set `borderRadius` to 0 if you don't want rounded corner).

```dart
SwipeableTile(
  color: Colors.white,
  swipeThreshold: 0.2,
  direction: SwipeDirection.horizontal,
  onSwiped: (direction) {// Here call setState to update state
  },
  backgroundBuilder: (context, direction, progress) {
    if (direction == SwipeDirection.endToStart) {
      // return your widget
    } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.startToEnd) {
      // return your widget
    }
    return Container();
  },
  key: UniqueKey(),
  child: // Here Tile which will be shown at the top
),

```

2. `SwipeableTile.card` This will make the tile look like card with constant rounded corner, unlike `SwipeableTile`. You also have to set the padding which will wrap around the tile as well background.

```dart
SwipeableTile.card(
  color: Color(0xFFab9ee8),
  shadow: BoxShadow(
    color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.35),
    blurRadius: 4,
    offset: Offset(2, 2),
  ),
  horizontalPadding: 16,
  verticalPadding: 8,
  direction: SwipeDirection.horizontal,
  onSwiped: (direction) {
    // Here call setState to update state
  },
  backgroundBuilder: (context, direction, progress) {
      // You can animate background using the progress
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: progress,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return AnimatedContainer(
          duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 400),
          color: progress.value > 0.4
              ? Color(0xFFed7474)
              : Color(0xFFeded98),
        );
      },
    );
  },
  key: UniqueKey(),
  child: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 4.0),
    child: // Here Tile which will be shown at the top
  ),
),
```

3. `SwipeableTile.swipeToTrigger` This is exactly the same as `SwipeableTile` but instead of dismiss it, it will trigger an action. The tile will return back to initial position when maximum drag reaches `swipeThreshold`

4. `SwipeableTile.swipeToTriggerCard` This is exactly the same as `SwipeableTile.card` but instead of dismiss it, it will trigger an action. The tile will return back to initial position when maximum drag reaches `swipeThreshold`

You can build the background dynamically and animate them using `backgroundBuilder`. Use `direction` parameter to check swipe direction and show different widget.

```dart
backgroundBuilder: (context, direction, progress) {
   if (direction == SwipeDirection.endToStart) {
       return Container(color: Colors.red);
   } else if (direction == SwipeDirection.startToEnd) {
       return Container(color: Colors.blue);
   }
   return Container();
},
```

The `progress` is basically the same animation controller responsible for tile slide animation. You can use this controller to animate the background.

To trigger vibration you have to check when tile is dragged certain animation controller value. And I used [vibration package](https://pub.dev/packages/vibration) for vibration and worked batter than [HapticFeedback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/HapticFeedback-class.html)

```dart
backgroundBuilder: (context, direction, progress) {
    bool vibrated = false;
    return AnimatedBuilder(
        animation: progress,
        builder: (context, child) {
        if (progress.value > 0.2 && !vibrated) {
            Vibration.vibrate(duration: 40);
            vibrated = true;
        } else if (progress.value < 0.2) {
            vibrated = false;
        }
    // return your background
        },
    );
},
```

`swipeThreshold` defines how far you can drag and will consider as dismiss. In case of swipe to trigger this will define maximun drag limit.

### How to swipe to trigger action?

It's possible to do from `backgroundBuilder` using `progress` parameter but to select exact message (or tile) requires calling `setState()` which is not possible from `backgroundBuilder` however you can call `setState()` from `onSwiped` callback which will invoke when the tile return to initial position.

Vibrate & animate the icon when it's dragged maximum by checking `progress.isCompleted` or you can check animation value. Then call `setState()` from `onSwiped` User will not notice unless you set `movementDuration` to longer time and `swipeThreshold` to 0.4 (which is default). Check the example app how it's implemented.
